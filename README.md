# Adafruit Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Protocols

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a low-power wireless energy protocol. Adafruit provides sample code
and apps to work over BLE. This repo documents the BLE protocols used by this sample code and apps.

## IDs

### Assigned Names

The Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG for short) administers identifiers used in the protocol
by individual companies.

Adafruit's Service UUID is **`0xfebb`**. (Confirm [here](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/assigned-numbers/16-bit-uuids-for-members/)) It is currently unused.

Adafruit's Company ID is **`0x0822`**. (Confirm [here](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/assigned-numbers/company-identifiers/)) It is used in the manufacturer data field in advertisments. More info below.

### Base UUID

Adafruit's 128-bit Universally Unique Identifiers (UUID) all share a base UUID. This saves memory in
some BLE stacks because the base UUID is deduplicated.

Adafruit's base UUID is **`ADAFxxxx-C332-42A8-93BD-25E905756CB8`** where the four `xxxx` are replaced with the 16-bit IDs used below.

## Services

### Bluefruit Service

This is the first-gen Adafruit service that packs sensor data and commands into a Nordic UART Service.

### Sensor Services

Starting with the CircuitPlayground Bluefruit, sensor data is made available via Services to be read
and configured by external devices over a dedicated connection using [a standard
firmware](https://learn.adafruit.com/bluefruit-playground-app/firmware) which is an Arduino sketch.

These services share two common characteristics:

**Measurement Period** - `0x0001`
Stores the number of milliseconds between measurements as a signed 32-bit int. `-1` stops a
measurement and `0` indicates as fast as possible. Both readable and writable.

**Service Version** - `0x0002`
Readable uint32 version number. Assume 1 if the characteristic is missing.

The third characteristic is specific to the data being sensed. It is always readable and notifiable.
The table below includes the 16-bit UUID (combined with the base ID above) and a description of the
data format including units. This table mirrors the measurement types used in CircuitPython drivers
as defined [here](https://circuitpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/design_guide.html#sensor-properties-and-units).
